# What makes burgers fall apart??

It's not about the fat content, honestly. Just make sure you don't have too many liquidy things in there, like too much Worchestershire sauce or onions, but whats also important is to make sure they are cold when you put them on the grill, AND do not keep flipping them. That will make the burger fall apart for sure.
to get your burgers to stay together you'd need to Place the ground beef in a bowl and break it up into chunks with a wooden spoon. Add 1 egg and 1/4 cup bread crumbs for each pound of ground beef, as well as seasonings as desired. Stir the additional ingredients into the ground beef until just mixed. but if it's the fast food burger then i can't help you.
