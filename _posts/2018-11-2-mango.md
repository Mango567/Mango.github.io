# Why burgers taste so good?

One reason why cooked meat is so hard to resist is that it's loaded with the taste known as umami (Japanese for “delicious”). ... Cooking releases glutamate, making foods more delicious. That is why, Breslin says, the umami taste — like the Maillard reaction — signals that meat has been cooked and thus is safer to eat. Burgers, like most fast food, are made with so much chemicals and so much preservatives and so much sugar that it becomes like a drug to us, making us want to eat more and more. Sugar is an addictive “drug” not only because it tastes good but because it seemingly wakes you up.

Additionally, don’t assume that all foods that are “bad” for you can’t be good for you, too. Red meat is packed with cholesterol and all sorts of artery-clogging substances, but it’s just as rich in vitamins and minerals stolen from whatever animal you’re consuming. Sweet sugars often come packed right along with Vitamin C and other useful molecules. It’s only recently that we’ve had the ability to isolate the “bad” things from the good, and evolution has had no real time to adapt.

## what makes burgers unhealthy?

 Some people say While most fast-food chains get under this .5 limit, their burgers still contain the unhealthy fat — and restaurant varieties can have up to 2.5 grams. ... That's well over the healthy range, which is between 18 to 31 grams per day, depending on your calorie intake.
 but mny others say Red meat, including hamburger, tends to be overlooked as part of a nutritious diet; but moderate amounts fit perfectly into a balanced diet. Hamburger meat packs your meal with nutrients, like iron, vitamin B-12 and protein. So if you're a generally healthy person, a hamburger once in awhile may have some benefits.
 Burgers can be high in sodium, with a double hamburger with mayo containing 1,081 milligrams. A small one-patty burger without mayo has only 258 milligrams of sodium. A high-sodium diet can lead to high blood pressure and an increased risk for heart disease, stroke and kidney disease.
Karen notes that the bun and fries that go with the burger tend to be unhealthy and that's a very fair response. ... Fast food restaurants make sure they mix a certain amount of beef and fat together so that the burger is soft and juicy, and easily cooked. High end burgers are made with lean beef.
