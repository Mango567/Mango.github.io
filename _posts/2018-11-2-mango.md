# Why burgers taste so good?

One reason why cooked meat is so hard to resist is that it's loaded with the taste known as umami (Japanese for “delicious”). ... Cooking releases glutamate, making foods more delicious. That is why, Breslin says, the umami taste — like the Maillard reaction — signals that meat has been cooked and thus is safer to eat. Burgers, like most fast food, are made with so much chemicals and so much preservatives and so much sugar that it becomes like a drug to us, making us want to eat more and more. Sugar is an addictive “drug” not only because it tastes good but because it seemingly wakes you up.

Additionally, don’t assume that all foods that are “bad” for you can’t be good for you, too. Red meat is packed with cholesterol and all sorts of artery-clogging substances, but it’s just as rich in vitamins and minerals stolen from whatever animal you’re consuming. Sweet sugars often come packed right along with Vitamin C and other useful molecules. It’s only recently that we’ve had the ability to isolate the “bad” things from the good, and evolution has had no real time to adapt.
