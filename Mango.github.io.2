## What About My About?

Now that you have settled into your new blog, it's time to fix up your "About" page. This is where you can say a little bit about yourself or your blog. To start, go to the main area of your repository where all of your files and folders live. Look for a file called "about.md." The ".md" stands for "markdown." Markdown helps us write HTML quickly and easily.

Click on "about.md" and then click on the small pencil icon to start editing your file. Keep your text simple. Add an image if you feel so moved.

That's it -- now the world will know a little bit more about you or your blog topic.

## README NOW!!!

No, README files aren't shouting. Actually, on Github pages they sort of are. The README file on a Github page is easily seen by every person who comes to visit your code. It doesn't show up on your blog, but remember, Github is all about sharing the code behind your blog, so make sure your README file has information about your project so other coders know what you're doing with your site. 

Again, all you have to do is click on the file, click on the pencil, and start writing. Use [Github markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) format for your text and you're all set. I like to keep my README files simple, but there's not reason not to add images just like a blog post.

## Great Job!

Now that you have a About page and a clear README file it's time to start writing more blog posts about your topic and share what you know with the world.
